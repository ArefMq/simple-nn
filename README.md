# Simple-NN

This project is the Neural Network course project in which I tried to implement a Neural Network from scratch and try to solve some image problems with it. Then, in the next assignment, I have tried to solve the Fashion-MNIST and the CIFAR-10 challenges using CNN and Keras library.

## Assignment #1 (MLP)
- [Day-1](https://github.com/ArefMq/simple-nn/blob/master/Day-1.ipynb): Implementing neural network with backpropagation and try to solve XOR problem.
- [Day-2](https://github.com/ArefMq/simple-nn/blob/master/Day-2.ipynb): Clean the code and make it more general in terms of using with different functions.
- [Day-3](https://github.com/ArefMq/simple-nn/blob/master/Day-3.ipynb): Try to solve MNIST challenge with this network. As a result, some additional functionality are also added to the network including **batch normalization** and **dropout** layers. [This attempt was not very successfull]

## Assignment #2 (CNN)
- [Day-5](https://github.com/ArefMq/simple-nn/blob/master/Day-5.ipynb): Solve Fashion-MNIST challenge. Implement both an MLP and a CNN to solve this problem and compare the results.
- [Day-6](https://github.com/ArefMq/simple-nn/blob/master/Day-6.ipynb): Solve CIFAR-10 with CNN implemented in Keras.

## Assignment #3 (RNN)
